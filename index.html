          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are child elements.</li>
          <li>The body of child elements are known as the parent element</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML element is where the name of the element describes its contents and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements and tags are used interchangably but element is from opening to closing and tag is inside angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Doctype HTML: declaration that tells the browser what document type to expect when opened.</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case sensitive.</li>
          <li>HTML Elements are case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Lang= "en": language english  </li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin (outside) indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding (inside) indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS: defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>3 ways to style: Inline, Internal, External Stylesheets</li>
          <li>Inline: when a dev wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Inline cont.: They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets because each inline style must be edited individually when you make a design change</li>
          <li>Internal: embedding an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using style element in the head element. The rules only apply to that page and you can configure CSS classes and IDs which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>Internal Note: a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>External: allows devs to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes changes easy. WHen using we link the file with the link element placed in the HTML head. </li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns: based on the idea that every section of code should have its own responsibility. Separation of Concerns refers to separating code into diff files based on use.</li>
          <li>Incorporate CSS: cd prework-study-guide - cd assets - touch style.css (creates file) - git status - git checkout main (confirms) - git checkout -b feature/add-css (switches branch)</li>
          <li>Selector: used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Dry Code: refers to not repeating yourself - so combine 2 or more selectors with same rules. (refer to notes for visual)</li>
          <li>text-align: one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>display: block - assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Link element: creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>Rel attribute: specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked.</li>
          <li>Href attribute: specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case index.hmtl). To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css</li>
          <li> Class attribute: class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which element will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Card = class selector (refer to notes for additional card notes and diagram)</li>

        <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. </li>
          <li>Const: allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. "locks down" When writing JS - we always want to start by declaring variables using const. The second we might use is let.  </li>
          <li>const shape = "circle": shape is the name of our container or variable and the data it stores is circle.</li>
          <li>Make it a habit to end with semicolon</li>
          <li>Console.log: method used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. </li>
          <li>Style.css: placed with head element. </li>
          <li>Script.js: placed within body (at bottom)</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops: used to control the order in which code is executed or if its executed at all.</li>
          <li>If statement: code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true. </li>
          <li>If statement: when computer encounters if statement in JS, it'll check to see if the condition we provide is truthy. If so it'll do whatever action we ask between the curly brackets. If not, computer will ignore whatever is in the curly brackets.</li>
          <li>Falsy: values of 0, -1, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or Boolean of false.</li>
          <li>Truthy: all others including Boolean of true.</li>
          <li>Else if: second condition</li>
          <li>=== : strict equality operator that checks to see if two values are equal and returns s Boolean result true if values are equal and false if not equal.</li>
          <li>Array: a group of related data "a single variable used to hold a group of data (typically data that is related im some way)</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only 1 type of data. A single array can store strings, number, and so on.</li>
          <li>Index: location number (first number in an index is 0 then 1 and so on. Zero Indexed and sequential)</li>
          <li>Loops: use the predictability pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. In order to use we need shapes index and arrays length. Length tells us how many times to repeat. (.lenghth)</li>
          <li>Let: allows us to change/reassign the value of the variable over time. Esp important in cases where we need to use the variable to store changing values like when iterating over an array using a for loop.</li>
          <li>For Loop: starting point- let x=0, condition- as long as the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running, final statement- x++ which is a shortcut that allows the array to iterate over each item. </li>
