# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

There was a need for a way to compile all notes from the prework and place them all in one place that could be accessed at any time. THe project was built to enable any student within the course to study all prework notes in a central location. We are able to visit a website to view all notes for each of the 4 topics covered.
